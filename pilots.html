<h2>Project Pilots</h2>

<h3> Trafford pilot </h3>
	<p>
This pilot focusses on the worklessness. Trafford innovation lab cooperated closely with Swirrl, who are handling the more technical aspects of modelling and storing the linked data. The goal is to build a tool that will bring together data from a range of sources to help understand the factors that contribute to, or are impacted by, worklessness. Unemployed, representatives from the Department for Work and Pensions; Trafford’s Economic Growth Team and the Greater Manchester Combined Authority are involved in the co-creation. This should result in less unemployment ad better use of spending on the worklessness.

<h3> Flemish Government </h3>
<p>
The Flemish Government utilizes the OGI ICT Toolkit to enhance their environmental policy making in terms of timely publication of the actual state of affairs related to environment, evaluations of the permits policy, and develop tools to benchmark the pollution of companies to others working in the same economical domain. Insight into the location of polluters were created, benchmarks with other geographical area and the impact of population on society. An environmental dashboard was created empowering citizens, with maps data on geographic map and connect datasets, previously disconnected.

<h3> The Greek Ministry of Administrative Reconstruction (MAREG) </h3>
<p>
MAREG uses the OpenGovIntelligence ICT Toolkit to improve the monitoring and management of Government Vehicles used by all Greek Public Agencies. Thousands of vehicles are owned by the government and little is known about their use. The data that MAREG possesses for this monitoring and management originate from different sources was not properly be defined, structured. In the pilot this data was disclosed and combined into new insights about the consumption of fuel, the purpose and the age of vehicles information. This information will facilitate internal decision making about the renewal of the fleet and the governance. Furthermore, this can result in increased transparency towards the public and better fleet management can save money.

<h3> Irish Marine Institute </h3>
<p>
Ireland’s national agency for marine research, technology development and innovation, uses the OpenGovIntelligence toolkit and co-creation to convert their oceanographic observations and measurements data to Linked Open Statistical Data enriching data with information from other Linked Data resources to create dashboards empowering governments, companies and citizens. The new insights results in benefits in three main domains 1) maritime search and rescue, 2) marine renewable energy development and 3) maritime tourism and leisure.
