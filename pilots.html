<h2>Project Pilots</h2>

<h3> Trafford pilot </h3>
	<p>
	<u>Description:</u> This pilot focusses on the worklessness. Trafford innovation lab cooperated closely with Swirrl, who are handling the more technical aspects of modelling and storing the linked data. The goal is to build a tool that will bring together data from a range of sources to help understand the factors that contribute to, or are impacted by, worklessness. Unemployed, representatives from the Department for Work and Pensions; Trafford’s Economic Growth Team and the Greater Manchester Combined Authority are involved in the co-creation. This should result in less unemployment ad better use of spending on the worklessness.
	<p>
	<u>Objective:</u> support Jobcentre Plus teams deliver services by co-developing a web application that visualises linked open statistical data on worklessness. Service requirements: (i) Target users are Jobcentre Plus work coaches and Local Authority leads for worklessness, (ii) Allow exploration of (geospatial) data to identify where service needs are greatest and where assets and groups that might support service delivery are located, (iii) Dashboard for decision-makers to get up-to-date information about worklessness.

<h3> Flemish Government </h3>
The objective is to support decision making on environmental permits and inspections: (i) As a citizen I would like to know which emissions are happening in our/a neighborhood, (ii) As a civil servant I want to know the already reported emissions in a neighborhood to evaluate new emission permit requests for that same area and plan emission inspection based on previous reporting to enhance efficiency, (iii) As a company I want to compare my emission values with similar companies.
