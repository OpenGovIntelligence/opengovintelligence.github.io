# Welcome

The OpenGovIntelligence project aims to modernize Public
Administration by connecting it to Civil Society through the
innovative application of Linked Open Statistical Data (LOSD). We
believe the publication of high quality public statistics can
transform society, services and enterprises throughout Europe.

## Updates to this website

MUST be done in the `v3` branch, **not** here. The workflow is:

1) switch to v3 branch
2) make your revisions
3) `yarn build`
4) commit to git
5) then copy the contents of the 'public' folder somewhere, switch to the master branch and overwrite the master branch with the new build
