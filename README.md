## To Build the CSS

This project uses the GruntJS build system. If you've not used this before, you are strongly advised to Google it! :-)

First time:

  bundle install
  npm install

Subsequently

  grunt

## To Edit the CSS

As an underlying framework, we use http://www.basscss.com

## CSS house style

#### Don't leak BassCSS into the html

Compose the bits you need into more understandably named selectors instead. Yes, I know this isn't necessarily how it was intended to be used - we're mostly using it to enforce consistent margins and padding.

#### Don't add arbitary margins and padding

Use BassCSS instead.
