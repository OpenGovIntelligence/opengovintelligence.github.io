Within the Greater Manchester Combined Authority, Trafford Council has been leading on the Skills, Employment & Worklessness programme. The Trafford pilot was designed around the need to bring datasets together and visualise them in order to help identify areas of need and inform service delivery.

We worked with Jobcentre Plus staff in Stretford, Department for Work and Pensions area managers and council leads for worklessness across Greater Manchester to provide tools and access to data which would help target resources and improve the services offered within the region.

The outputs from the pilot were produced through an iterative co-creation process involving all partners to ensure they met their requirements.

<blockquote>I'm amazed that this is the result of the [co-creation] workshop because I didn't feel like I contributed that much [...] However, if you'd asked me after what it is that I wanted that is it.</blockquote>

You can try the applications and learn more about the pilot from our dedicated [project page](http://www.trafforddatalab.io/opengovintelligence/) and find further information in our [Medium article](https://medium.com/@traffordDataLab/improving-the-discoverability-of-worklessness-data-b91bf28e6fd6).
