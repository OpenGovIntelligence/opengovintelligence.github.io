## Improving public services with multidimensional statistical data

OpenGovIntelligence was a three year project in the EU Horizon 2020 programme, that finished in January 2019.

We created a methodology and software tools for developing co-created data-driven public services, tested and demonstrated in a series of pilot projects.

You can find all our software, publications and project reports in this site.  Some highlights:
