# Pilots

The project explored how data could be applied via a co-created process, to improve the design and delivery of public services. It was important to understand how this could work in practice, so six pilot projects were carried out over the three years of the project.  Each involved understanding a problem, preparing and analysing data, and investigating how that could be applied.

The insights from the pilots were used to shape and improve the software toolkit and service design methodology and to show that the OpenGovIntelligence approach could help in providing better public services to citizens and businesses.
